# The bullseye image tag maps to Debian 11, which is referred to as Debianâ€™s
# current stable release, and has an estimated end of life date of June 2026.
#
# The official Node.js Docker team also maintains the `slim` image tags that
# explicitly target the tooling needed for a functional Node.js environment
# and nothing else.
